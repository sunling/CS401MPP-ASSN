a)

There is compile time error because of not being covariant.
List<Integer> and List<Number> are not covariant.

b)

However, in the second one, they both were made covariant using the wild
card characters. However, when it add item to the second list whose parameter type extends
from number, it shows compile error because the list does not know what value it is taking , that;s why
it shows compile error.
