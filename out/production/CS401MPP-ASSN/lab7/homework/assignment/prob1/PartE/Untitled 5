a. If the java class inherits the same implemented method from interface and class, super class implementation
wins.

b. If both interfaces have unimplemented method with the same signature, the class can implement the method with
no problem. However, if one of the interfaces has default implemented method,the class must either override of the methods
or declare it as abstract method.

c. If one of them has default method, the extending interface must either declare unimplemented abstract method 
or implemented default method.
